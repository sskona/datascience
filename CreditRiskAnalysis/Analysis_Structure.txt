Data Cleaning

	- Outliter treatment 
		(will do in the end after this flow, by removing extreme outliers. 
			This also helps making x-axis without 2e+0.1 kind of values)
	
	- Funded Amount
	- Annaul Income
	- Credit Loss (?)
	
Derived Metrics

	- Credit Loss (Should be much before in derived metrics)
		funded_amnt - total_rec_prncp
	
Correlation Matrix of Various Metrics	

	- Correlation Matrix

Univariate Analysis - Using Counts only

	- Funded Amount (Histogram & Box Plot)
	- Credit Loss (Histogram & Box Plot)
	- Loan Status (Histogram for 3 groups)
	- US States (Map Visualization & Top 5 States with Bar Charts)
	- Date/Year wise (Line)
	- Annual Income (?)

Segmented Variate Analysis with 'Loan Status' - Using Counts Only

	- Purpose
		- Debit Consolidation has highest Defaults
		- Small Business & Credit card come next
	- Home Ownership
		- RENT & MORTAGAGE are Highest with 92% (approx)
	- Term
		- 60 Months has highest 
	- Interest Rate

	- Employment Length

	- Annul Income
	- DTI 
	- Grade

- Now Analysis of Defaulted Records Only Filter (Loan_Status = 'Chargedoff')
- Let's start PPT preparation after this Step

Bi-Variate Analysis

	- Interest Rate vs Credit Loss (Scatter Plot continuos variable & Bar Chart using decrete BINs)
		- Infer >17% has highest
		- 11-14 & 14-17 are next highest
	- Funding Amount Vs Credit Loss (Scatter Plot continuos variable & Bar Chart using decrete BINs)
		- Infere 20K-25K has highest credit risk
	- Employment Length Vs Credit Loss (Bar Chart using decrete)
		- Infer >10 has highest risk
	- DTI Vs Credit Loss (Scatter Plot continuos variable & Bar Chart using decrete BINs)

Multi-Variate Analysis

	Fixed Filters - Home Ownership (RENT & MORTAGAGE)
	
	Purpose: Debt Consolidation, Small Business, Credit Cards

	Analyse following for 'Purpose' acorss 'Term'
	
		- Intrest Rates
		- Funding Amount
		- Annul Income
			
Obervations and Driving Factors

	  Basic:
		- Purpose - Debt Consolidation
				  - % 57% Credit Loss Overall
		- Home Ownership (RENT & MORTAGAGE)
				- 92%
				
				
		- 60 Months Term
				- 26% for overall credit loss
				- 30% for Desbt Consolidation

		- Interest Rate >17% 
				- 30% for overall
				- 34% for Debt Consolidation
		- Interest Rate 11-14, 14-17
				- 54% for over all
				- 51% for Debt Consolidation
		
		- 20K-25K Funding Amount
				- 40% for overall credit loss
				- 46% for Debt Consolidation

Final Suggestions

		- For Interest Rate 11-17%
				- No 20K-25K Funding Amount 
				- No 60 Months ?
		
		- For Interest Rate > 17%
				- No 60 Months ?
